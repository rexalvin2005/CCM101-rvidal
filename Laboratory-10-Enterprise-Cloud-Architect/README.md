## 📌 Executive Summary & Project Intent

Modern enterprise infrastructure requires rigorous decoupling between public-facing application layers and sensitive transactional data stores. Within this project workspace, an enterprise-class **WordPress and MySQL** cluster is fully containerized and orchestrated inside a localized **Ubuntu Server** operational environment. 

By enforcing strict access control boundaries through custom bridge networking and persistent volume mapping, this deployment eliminates single-point-of-failure risks, protects database credentials from public exposure, and guarantees state preservation across continuous application lifecycles.

## 🏗️ Detailed System Architecture & Network Topology

The architecture establishes an isolated internal network space (`enterprise_net`) where the application tier acts as the sole gateway to backend database transactions. External traffic is filtered through a designated host port mapping directly to the CMS engine.

## 🧩 Comprehensive Component Breakdown

| Tier / Service | Container Name | Core Responsibility | Network Exposure | Storage & Data Persistence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Front-End Layer** | `enterprise_wordpress_app` | Processes HTTP requests, executes core CMS logic, and serves theme assets. | Public Port: `8080:80` | Bind-mounted application folders for theme/plugin adjustments. |
| **Data Tier** | `enterprise_mysql_db` | Handles relational table schemas, user authentication credentials, and post states. | Internal Only (`3306`) | Isolated named Docker volume (`db_data`) mapped to `/var/lib/mysql`. |
