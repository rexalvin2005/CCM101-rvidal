# Laboratory 03 - Multi-Cloud Explorer

## Mission Overview

This laboratory activity focuses on exploring and comparing major cloud computing platforms. The three platforms investigated are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The activity also involves researching their infrastructure, services, advantages, and common enterprise use cases. Linux commands were used in the KillerCoda Playground to investigate a cloud-based Linux environment.

## Objectives

- Explore AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
- Compare their major cloud services.
- Identify the strengths of each cloud provider.
- Recommend cloud platforms based on business requirements.
- Investigate Linux system resources using command-line tools.
- Practice technical documentation using Markdown.
- Improve my GitHub Cloud Computing Portfolio.

## Cloud Platforms Investigated

The three cloud platforms investigated in this laboratory are:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Linux Investigation

The KillerCoda Linux environment was investigated using several Linux commands.
